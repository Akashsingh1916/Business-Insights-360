# AtliQ Business Insights 360

## Project Overview

AltiQ Hardware, a fast-growing company expanding globally, specializes in selling computers and accessories through three main channels: retailers, direct sales, and distributors.

Despite its growth, the company faced unexpected losses after opening a store in America. These setbacks were identified through surveys, intuition, and basic Excel analysis. With competitors boasting robust analytics teams, AltiQ Hardware recognizes the urgent need to develop its own analytics capabilities to thrive in the industry.

To surpass competitors and enable data-driven decision-making, the company has decided to implement Power BI for analytics. This project aims to provide stakeholders with insights into finance, sales, marketing, and supply chain, ensuring informed decisions at all levels.

I worked on this project by following the Codebasics PowerBi Course, Here is my report link - 

## Datasets:

Before diving into analysis, understanding the datasets is crucial. The datasets consist of two tables:

**Dimension table:** Static data like customer and product details.

**Fact table:** Transaction data.

### Importing Data and Data Modeling:

Data was imported from MySQL into Power BI, and a data model was created after cleaning and transforming the data. But why data modeling is very important for analysis right??

If you break down the whole work of a data analyst then you will come up with 4 steps of work 

✅ Data Extract ---> ✅ Data Cleaning---> ✅ Data Modelling ---> ✅ Data Analysis

See you can't skip the 3rd step if you want to reach the last step (analysis part), 
Data modeling is essential because it lays the foundation for reports. All visuals are built upon the data model, and poor modeling can affect report performance.

In this project, we have followed the Snowflake schema data modeling method.
